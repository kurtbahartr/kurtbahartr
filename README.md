# Yo, welcome!

- I'm a computer engineering student minding my own business.\*
- I'm a regular package maintainer at @pisilinux since version 2.4 "Karag√ºl" (Dark Rose).\*\*
- I'm a member of the Windows Insider Program since September 2016.
- I have a total of 19 badges -2 for flights, 3 for feedback, 3 for quests, 9 for milestones, and 2 for engagement- as a member of the Windows Insider Program.
- I have experimentations and experiences regarding Linux that could be called rather silly at hand.
- I have 3 working laptops, 1 working tablet and 3 working smartphones in my home lab.
- I'm a member of two startup groups and going towards becoming a company with one of them.
- I usually use Windows because of school but I erase Windows\*\*\* and switch to Linux whenever I get the chance to (For example in summer holidays).
- I might be incredibly paranoid and this might seep into my code and workstyle most of the time.
- If I SHOUT or swear in code comments, know that the errors I got or the situations I came across back there made me pull my hair. These situations are usually the common practice in source codes anyway.

\* I mean "not caring about others' personal requests, but approaching their feedbacks with utmost care" with "minding my own business"

\*\* My regular maintenance proceeds with others' tests as long as I can't test them myself.

\*\*\* I don't set up Windows from scratch when I want to erase it entirely and reinstall it. I back it up and Clonezilla does a good job for this - It's my recommendation.

# Programming and prototyping languages I prefer

1. C
  
2. C++
  
3. C#
  
4. Java
  
5. Scripts for POSIX-compatible shells
  
6. PowerShell
  
7. HTML+CSS
  
8. Python
  
9. Other XML-esque programming and prototyping languages
  
10. YML and other programming and prototyping languages based on it (Such as Ansible)
  

I listed the programming and prototyping languages I mentioned above not because I'm good at them, but because they're my preferences and those I feel comfortable working with. There's no specific programming or prototyping language I'm particularly good at, never will there be such either.
